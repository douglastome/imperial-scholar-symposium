                    <p> Title of talk: "Blue sky to terra firma: from climate policy ambition to practical action"</p>
                  <p>Professor Jim Skea is currently the Co-chair of Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Working Group III covers the mitigation of climate change, i.e. methods for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and enhancing atmospheric sinks. Working Group III is responsible for the one of the three main IPCC reports due in 2021, is managing the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land due in 2019 and is contributing to the scientific leadership of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C due in 2018. From 2012 to 2017, Jim was Research Councils UK Energy Strategy Fellow. Until 2012, Jim was Research Director of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). He led the UKERC Phase I Energy 2050 project which led to publication of the book Energy 2050: Making the transition to a secure low-carbon energy system. Jim has strong links to policy processes. He is a founding member of the UK's Committee on Climate Change. He was President of the Energy Institute from 2015 to 2017 and is currently immediate Past-president. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh. He was awarded an OBE for services to sustainable transport in 2004 and a CBE for services to sustainable energy in 2013.</p>

                        <p> Sian Harding is Acting Head of the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London and Director of the Imperial British Heart Foundation Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine Centre.  Her work has centered on the myocardium in heart failure, especially beta-adrenergic mechanisms.  She was Scientific PI on the first UK Gene therapy Trial in LVAD patients, aimed at improving cardiac contractility. She is now studying the pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte, both for disease modelling and cardiac repair. Professor Harding is former President of the European Section of the International Society for Heart Research.  She has been elected Fellow of the ISHR, the American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, British Society of Pharmacology and Society of Biology. She is on the Board of the British Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.
